What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?

This assignment was extremely helpful in getting me comfortable with
using pointers and clearing up my misconceptions on it. It was also
helpful doing both an array and a pointer implementation to see the
similarities between the two and how to adapt an algorithm to fit both
implementations. While tedious at sometimes to debug the cornercases
in my replace code, this assignment was very fun overall, and I enjoyed
putting all of the C programming skills I've learned so far together in
an assignment. I also feel more comfortable using bash and coding in C.

Is it possible for Str_copy or Str_concat to call assert to verify
that the destination memory area specified by the caller is large
enough? Explain.

It's not possible for Str_copy or Str_concat to use assert to check if
the destination memory area specified by the caller is large enough.
These functions only receive pointers to the strings, and pointers don't
store any info on memory size. They can't determine how much memory was
set aside for the destination, whether it's on the heap or stack, or if
there's even enough room for the operation. Without this information,
they can't reliably verify the destination's capacity or prevent
potential memory overflows.
